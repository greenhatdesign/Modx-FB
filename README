Integrating Facebook connect with Modx Evolution WebLogin
=========================================================

Current at: June 2011

The following is based on earlier work referenced at http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php?topic=32390.20.


This code uses the latest Facebook connect php SDK (see https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/).
It's been tested on Modx Evolution 1.0.5 only.  It's in production at imagebank.org.uk.


What it does:
-------------

The code assumes that Modx holds the "definitive" username, password and fullname, and that you want to add
the option to sign in using Facebook to an existent form which uses the WebLogin snippet, or want to
allow people to sign in either using Facebook or a WebLogin.  The steps used are;

1. Check if this is a facebook logon.  If so, see whether the user (the Facebook user number)
exists in the Modx database.  If not, query Facebook to get the user reference number (Facebook ID -
see http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/ for details)
and full name.
2. If necessary, create a new account using the Facebook reference number (Facebook ID) as the username
and the full name from Facebook as the fullname.  Only these two are recorded, together with the password.
3. The password is made up from the Facebook ID concatenated with a word or whatever that YOU define.  This
is called the $passwordpostfix in the code, and is there to stop others hacking in using a Facebook ID.
4. The newly created (or existing) account is then used to log in to the site.
5. If this is not a Facebook login, we just log in using a Modx username and password as usual.
6. That's it!  Note that you will need to sort out logout as well, and will probably want to use
the Facebook ID (stored as username) to get the avatar from Facebook - there are lots of other things
you can get from the Facebook ID as well - see http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/.

How to implement:
-----------------

Before you start on Modx, go to Facebook and get an app ID and secret.  See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/

1.  Ensure you have the WebLogin snippet installed.
2.  Get a copy of facebook.php from the Facebook php SDK (https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/tree/master/src)
    and copy it to a new directory you create at yourwebsite.com/facebook/.  If you prefer to put this elsewhere
    you can change the location in WebLoginFB snippet.php (line 113)
3.  Open the file "login.function.inc.php" and edit line 19.  Change the $passwordpostfix value to something you want to use
4.  Copy the file "login.function.inc.php" to the /assets/snippets/weblogin/ directory on your server.
5.	Open the file "WebLoginFB snippet.php" and edit line 97.  Change the $usergroup to the usergroup you want to add users to.
5.  Still in WebLoginFB snippet.php edit line 100.  Change the $passwordpostfix value to the value used in step 2.
6.  Still in WebLoginFB snippet.php add your Facebook app ID and secret at line 116/7 (search for [YOUR_APP_ID]).
7.  In Modx, create a new snippet called WebLoginFB and copy the contents of your edited file into it.
8.  Now in your page, you will need to put in the relevant function calls.  There is a sample shown as "sign in with FB.html".
    Make sure you change the [YOUR_APP_ID] to your own Facebook app ID.  Put the code <fb:login-button>Sign in with Facebook</fb:login-button>
    wherever you want the "Sign in with Facebook" button to appear.    Put the WebLoginFB snippet call (uncached)
    where you want the log in using Modx to appear.

Things to be aware of
---------------------

1. The user email isn't stored - we use a dummy "pleaseenter@youremail.here" for this field.
2. If a user changes their Facebook full name it won't be changed in Modx
3. If a user changes their full name on Modx then (depending on whether you access the fullname through the Facebook Graph API)
   it may not show up when you display in Modx.
